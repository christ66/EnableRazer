EnableRazer 0.0.4


Overview
**********
Utility built on Haskell to enable the capture of extended keys from Razer
BlackWidow Stealth Ultimate and Anansi keyboards.  Once they can be captured,
they can then be handled by whatever hardware event management interface used.


Technical
**********
This utility sends an initialization signal to Razer keyboard devices which
allows them to generate keycodes which can then be processed in the same way as
any other keyboard device.  Note that the keycodes generated may need to be
remapped to perform a desired function.


License
**********
Please see the file LICENSE which should be included with this distribution.


Requirements
**********
This utility has build-time dependencies on:
 - The Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc)
 - Haskell USB package
 - libusb-1.0

There is also a runtime dependency on:
 - libusb-1.0


Checking Hardware
**********
Before building this utility, it is advisable to check that your hardware
device ID is included.  To obtain the hardware ID of your device on Linux,
use the following command :

lsusb -d 1532:

This will display the hardware ID of all Razer devices connected to the USB bus
in the format

Bus nnn Device nnn: ID 1532:dddd Razer USA, Ltd

The ID, "1532:dddd" is what is used to identify your device, where 'dddd' is
the product identifier (required below).

Currently included hardware ID's are 010d, 010e and 010f.  If your device ID is
not in that list, then you need to modify 'EnableRazer/src/Main.hs' at line 67
and add your device ID in the format "0xdddd" (as per the other ID's listed
there).  Note that EnableRazer will send the initialization signal any device
with a matching ID, so if you have other devices with an ID in that list that
you do not want an initialization signal sent to, you must remove that ID.


Installation
**********
On most linux distributions, this package can be installed using the following
method:
 - Install the 'ghc', 'cabal-install' and 'libusb' packages using your package
   manager of choice
 - cabal update
 - cabal install usb
 - cd EnableRazer/
 - cabal configure
 - cabal build

Once built, copy the binary 'EnableRazer/dist/build/EnableRazer/EnableRazer'
to a location in your $PATH (eg. '/sbin/EnableRazer').


Usage
**********
There are no usage options.  Simply run the EnableRazer binary and it will send
the initialization signal to devices with the listed ID's.  If successful, the
output

WRITING SET_REPORT
OK

should be displayed.  If it is not, then the device was likely not initialized
and you may need to investigate the "Checking Hardware" section above.
